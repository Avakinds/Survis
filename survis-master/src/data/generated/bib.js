        "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing technology once thought of as futuristic to become possible and utilised at the consumer level. Many technological barriers to human-computer interaction have been overcome, and there is now a focus on the sociological acceptance of such technology. Inferring human emotional states is a time-consuming process and can be automated with computer vision. In this study, we explore how computer vision and face recognition systems can be leveraged to automatically infer human emotional states from the face. Rather than the classical single-emotion classification method, our aim is to explore whether it is possible to perform regression techniques to observe valence and arousal. Following the topology tuning of 33 different neural networks, the results show that valence and arousal can be predicted by a branched Convolutional Neural Network model with a mean squared error of 0.066 and 0.107, respectively. In addition, we discuss methods of improving the model, as well as uses of the technology, which include the autonomous monitoring of affect during situations of technological acceptance.",

The positioning technology has many advantages such as faster speed, higher accuracy and more stable and reliable positioning results. Therefore, it plays an important role in the fields of robot technology, military reconnaissance, geographic survey and field measurement. Based on the positioning technology, the paper designs an embedded vision system with DM816x microprocessor (the processing module) and CCD camera equipped with an infrared filter (the acquisition module), which realizes the recognition and positioning of the fire. Moreover, with 200 groups of experiments in a warehouses, the fire detection system has an alarm accuracy rate over 98%, and positioning accuracy of fire is far higher than the national standard of China. In addition, an automatic fire protection system is proposed, which consists of the fire detector and the water cannon, then it can automatically extinguish the fire when a fire is detected.",

With the development of tunnel engineering in China, it is inevitable to encounter various complex geological environments, such as karst, red clay and frozen soil. Engineering research in these complex environments also promotes the development of tunnel technology. In this paper, the calculation method of tunnel structure load is studied by analyzing computer vision technology (CVT) and simulation technology (ST); This paper discusses the application and analysis of CVT and ST in railway tunnel construction (RTC), and finally verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of CVT and ST in RTC through simulation experiments, which has great reference significance and reference value for the construction of similar projects in the future.",
